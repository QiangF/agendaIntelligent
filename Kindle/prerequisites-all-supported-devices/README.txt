The launcher application requires a few prerequisites: the developer certificates, and the Kindlet jailbreak.

If you get an error message that the application could not be started because your Kindle is not registered
as a test Kindle (or similar), install the developer certificates.

If you get a message that the Kindlet Jailbreak is not installed, well... install the Kindlet Jailbreak.

To install (or uninstall) a prerequisite, copy the corresponding .bin file to your Kindle, then choose
the "Update" entry from the Settings menu.

The included files are named according to their purpose, and the devices that they work on. If you have a
Kindle 3 (Keyboard) for example, then you must use the files which contain the first four letters of your device's
serial number - you can determine your serial number from the Device Information entry on the Settings
page.  

If you have a Touch or PW device the files labelled <deviceType>_"ALL" should meet your needs.

We have also included gpg files that can be used to check the files authenticity. Details on the main thread.
