  KindleTool convert [options] <input>...

    Converts a Kindle update package to a gzipped TAR file, and delete input

    Options:
        -c, --stdout                Write to standard output, keeping original files unchanged
        -i, --info                  Just print the package information, no conversion done
        -s, --sig                   OTA V2 updates only. Extract the package signature.
        -k, --keep                  Don't delete the input package.
        -u, --unsigned              Assume input is an unsigned package
        -w, --unwrap                Just unwrap the package, if it's wrapped in an UpdateSignature header

  KindleTool extract <input> <output>

    Extracts a Kindle update package to a directory

  KindleTool create <type> <devices> [options] <dir|file>... [ <output> ]

    Creates a Kindle update package
    You should be able to throw a mix of files & directories as input without trouble.
    Just keep in mind that by default, if you feed it absolute paths, it will archive absolute paths, which usually isn't what you want!
    If input is a single tarball (".tgz" or ".tar.gz") file, we assume it is properly packaged (bundlefile & sigfile), and will only convert it to an update.
    Output should be a file with the extension ".bin", if it is not provided, or if it's a single dash, output to stdout.
    In case of OTA updates, all files with the extension ".ffs" or ".sh" will be treated as update scripts.

    Options:
        All the following options are optional and advanced.
        -k, --key <file>            PEM file containing RSA private key to sign update. Default is popular jailbreak key.
        -b, --bundle <type>         Manually specify package magic number. Overrides "type". Valid bundle versions:
                                      FB01, FB02 = recovery; FB03 = recovery2; FC02, FD03 = ota; FC04, FD04, FL01 = ota2
        -s, --srcrev <ulong|uint>   OTA updates only. Source revision. OTA V1 uses uint, OTA V2 uses ulong.
                                      Lowest version of device that package supports. Default is 0.
        -t, --tgtrev <ulong|uint>   OTA & Recovery V2 updates only. Target revision. OTA V1 uses uint, OTA V2 & Recovery V2 uses ulong.
                                      Highest version of device that package supports. Default is ulong/uint max value.
        -h, --hdrrev <uint>         Recovery V2 & Recovery FB02 updates only. Header Revision. Default is 0.
        -1, --magic1 <uint>         Recovery updates only. Magic number 1. Default is 0.
        -2, --magic2 <uint>         Recovery updates only. Magic number 2. Default is 0.
        -m, --minor <uint>          Recovery updates only. Minor number. Default is 0.
        -c, --cert <ushort>         OTA V2 updates only. The number of the certificate to use (found in /etc/uks on device). Default is 0.
                                      0 = pubdevkey01.pem, 1 = pubprodkey01.pem, 2 = pubprodkey02.pem
        -o, --opt <uchar>           OTA V1 updates only. One byte optional data expressed as a number. Default is 0.
        -r, --crit <uchar>          OTA V2 updates only. One byte optional data expressed as a number. Default is 0.

        -u, --unsigned              Build an unsigned package.
        -C, --legacy                Emulate the behaviour of yifanlu's KindleTool regarding directories. By default, we behave like tar:
                                      every path passed on the commandline is stored as-is in the archive. This switch changes that, and store paths
                                      relative to the path passed on the commandline, like if we had chdir'ed into it.


  KindleTool info <serialno>

    Get the default root password
    Unless you changed your password manually, the first password shown will be the right one.
    (The Kindle defaults to DES hashed passwords, which are truncated to 8 characters.)
    If you're looking for the recovery MMC export password, that's the second one.

notices:
  1) Kindle 4.0+ has a known bug that prevents some updates with meta-strings to run.
  2) Currently, even though OTA V2 supports updates that run on multiple devices, it is not possible to create an update package that will run on both the Kindle 4 (No Touch) and Kindle 5 (Kindle Touch).
