Kindle Paperwhite Jailbreak for versions 5.2.0, 5.3.0, 5.3.1, 5.3.4
===================================================================

This is a jailbreak for the Kindle Paperwhite.
It does NOT work on other Kindle models, and it does not work
on firmware 5.3.3.

Simply follow the instructions in this file to unlock the full
potential of your Paperwhite! ;-)

HOW TO INSTALL THE JAILBREAK
----------------------------

In the archive that you downloaded, you will find several other files.
Plug the Kindle to your computer, and:
1. Copy the "jailbreak.sh" and "MOBI8_DEBUG" files directly to the root
   directory of the attached drive (i.e., not into "documents" or any
   other directory).
2. Copy the "jailbreak.mobi" file into the "documents" directory
   on the Kindle.
3. Safely eject the "Kindle" drive, and disconnect the device.
4. You will see a new document called "Paperwhite Jailbreak". Open this
   document. Make sure that you are viewing it in portrait mode.
5. Follow the instructions in the document. That's it!


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

Q: Do I need to reboot after the jailbreak for it to come into effect?
A: No. It is available immediately after installation. However, the
   developer certificates require a restart before they are recognized.
   So if in doubt, restart the device.

Q: The jailbreak document disappeared after the procedure, but a new one
   called "jailbreak-log" appeared. WTF?
A: This is on purpose. The files that you installed are only required
   during the jailbreak, and should not be there during normal operation.
   Therefore, the "installer" removes itself after it was successfully
   executed. It does leave behind a log file, which is mostly meant for
   troubleshooting if anything goes wrong. You can safely delete that file.

Q: What does the jailbreak actually do? What is it good for?
A: In one sentence: the jailbreak allows you to customize your Kindle. It
   does not actually do anything by itself, but it "opens the door" for
   other customizations. What it really does is to install a file which
   tells the Kindle to accept update packages created not only by Amazon,
   but also by other people.

Q: But the installer seems to do a lot of things...?
A: Yes, it does. By default, it installs the developer certificate for
   device updates, a few known mobileread developer certificates for Kindle
   Apps (Kindlets), a startup script which tries to ensure that the
   jailbreak survives future firmware updates, and a "rescue pack" which
   may allow to repair a broken ("bricked") device in most circumstances.
   You can control what is happening during installation by editing the
   jailbreak.sh file, but this is only recommended for experienced
   developers. For everyone else, the defaults will work just fine.

Q: If my Kindle gets updated to a newer version, do I need to reinstall
   modifications?
A: Yes, you have to reinstall all modifications, possibly including the
   developer certificates, and the rescue pack. However, the most important
   bit, namely the jailbreak itself, should be preserved.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to the great dev community at mobileread, and in particular
to NiLuJe, geekmaster, and yifanlu. This jailbreak would not have been
possible without your efforts.
